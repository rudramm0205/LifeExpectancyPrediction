# LifeExpectancyPrediction
This project was a group project which was assigned to us in Modelling Experimental Data Module.
We are being given a Life expectancy Dataset from around the world for the year 2019 and we need to Predict the Life Expectancy based on numerous factors.
When we encountered with the dataset we found out that the dataset has a lot of NULL values so We compared the Imputation of Mean and Mediam methods and Replaced the NULL Values with Imputation of Mean method.
While executing the VIF function we found out that there was no Multi-collinearity in our data.
We used Linear regression with Life expectancy as the Dependent Variable.
Accuracy of the Linear Model was 89%.
Adjusted Net National Income, Adjusted Net National Income per capita, Primary Completion Rate, Total Population, Total unemployment, Compulsory Education Duration are the significant factors that affect Life expectancy.
